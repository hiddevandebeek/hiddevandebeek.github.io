::: {#hero-heading}
Hi, I'm Hidde! I'm a Master's student at Utrecht University, where I study Methodology and Statistics. I'm planning to graduate in June 2024 and I'm currently looking for a PhD position. 

Currently I'm writing my Thesis on the performance of Information Criteria and Internal validation techniques in a simulated setting. The project is based in Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care supervised by [dr. Maarten van Smeden](https://www.umcutrecht.nl/en/research/researchers/van-smeden-maarten-m) and [dr. Anne de Hond](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anne-de-hond/?originalSubdomain=nl).

In my free time I'm a rower at U.S.R. Triton. Here I train 10-12 times a week and compete in national and international competitions. My most beloved experience is reaching the semi-finals in the Temple eight of the [Henley Royal Regatta](https://www.hrr.co.uk/) in 2022.
