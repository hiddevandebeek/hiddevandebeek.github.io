Hi, I'm Hidde! I'm a PhD candidate in Pharmacometrics and Statistics at Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research (LACDR) under supervision of [dr. Laura Zwep](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laura-zwep-572486122/) and [Prof. dr. Coen van Hasselt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/coenvanhasselt/). I graduated in June 2024 with a MSc in Methodology and Statistics at Utrecht University. 

Currently I'm working on pharmacometric research in the field of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) in the [LACDR](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science/pharmacology/organisation/pharmacometrics). My research focusses on proper statistical methods for covariate model development and the usage of aggregate data in PKPD analysis. I'm recently published the R package [`admr`](https://vanhasseltlab.github.io/admr/) for aggregate data population PK modelling.

In my free time I like to go hiking in Scotland, Norway, the Lake District, or anywhere else where I can find some mountains. Here I go back into the wild and enjoy the beautiful nature. I enjoy the bare necessities of life and the simplicity of the outdoors. My most recent bikepacking trip was to Italy, where I cycled from Rome to Como crossing the Apennines. My most recent hiking trip was Troms border trail at the Norwegian-Swedish-Finish border, where I hiked 150 km in 10 days through the summer-time arctic nature.

I used to row at [U.S.R. Triton](https://usrtriton.nl/) in Utrecht. Here I trained 10-12 times a week and competed in national and international competitions. My most beloved experience is reaching the semi-finals in the Temple eight of the [Henley Royal Regatta](https://www.hrr.co.uk/) in 2022. This one of the most prestigious rowing regattas in the world. Next to this, I won the prestigious Amstelbeker in 2024, a yearly national sprint competition for the best rowing clubs in the Netherlands.
