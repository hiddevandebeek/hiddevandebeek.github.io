Hi, I'm Hidde! I'm a PhD candidate in Pharmacometrics and Statistics at Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research (LACDR) under [dr. Laura Zwep](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laura-zwep-572486122/) and [Prof. dr. Coen van Hasselt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/coenvanhasselt/). I graduated in June 2024 with a MSc in Methodology and Statistics at Utrecht University. 

Currently I'm working on pharmacometric research in the field of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PKPD) in the [LACDR](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science/pharmacology/organisation/pharmacometrics). My research focusses on proper statistical methods for model evaluation and selection in PKPD analysis. I'm also working on the development of a new R package for PKPD analysis in R, where I would like to contribute to the open science of nlmixr2. A package for nonlinear mixed effects models in R by [Matthew Fidler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-fidler-7b1b3b1/).

My Masters Thesis was on the performance of Information Criteria and Internal validation techniques in a simulated setting. The project is based in Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care supervised by [dr. Maarten van Smeden](https://www.umcutrecht.nl/en/research/researchers/van-smeden-maarten-m) and [dr. Anne de Hond](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anne-de-hond/?originalSubdomain=nl).

In my free time I like to go hiking in Scotland, Norway or the Lake District. Here I go back into the wild and enjoy the beautiful nature.

I used to row at [U.S.R. Triton](https://usrtriton.nl/) in Utrecht. Here I trained 10-12 times a week and competed in national and international competitions. My most beloved experience is reaching the semi-finals in the Temple eight of the [Henley Royal Regatta](https://www.hrr.co.uk/) in 2022. This one of the most prestigious rowing regattas in the world. Next to this, I won the prestigious Amstelbeker in 2024, a yearly national sprint competition for the best rowing clubs in the Netherlands.
