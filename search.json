I’m planning to graduate in June 2024 and I’m currently looking for a PhD position.\nCurrently I’m writing my Thesis on the performance of Information Criteria and Internal validation techniques in a simulated setting. The project is based in Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care supervised by dr. Maarten van Smeden and dr. Anne de Hond.\nIn my free time I’m a rower at U.S.R. Triton. Here I train 10-12 times a week and compete in national and international competitions. My most beloved experience is reaching the semi-finals in the Temple eight of the Henley Royal Regatta in 2022."
