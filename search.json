    "text": "Bayesian Statistics\nIn this project for the course Bayesian Statistics by Prof. dr. Herbert Hoijtink, the main goal was to develop a Gibbs sampler for a Bayesian linear regression model. By using two simulated data set the Gibbs sampler was tested and the results were compared. The Gibbs sampler was then applied to a real data set to identify the key factors that play a role in the University admittance process, using a open source data set. We used non-informative conjugate priors, as specified in the info note underneath. Next to this Bayesian Model Averaging was used to identify the most important variables in the model. The project was rewarded a 10.0/10.0 grade. The project can be found here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nTheorem\n\\(Y_i = b_0 + b_1x_{1i} + b_2x_{2i} + b_3x_{3i} + e_i\\) with \\(e_i\\) i.i.d. \\(\\sim N(0,1/\\tau)\\) and priors\n\\(b_0 ... b_3 \\sim N(0,1/\\tau_b)\\)\n\\(\\tau \\sim gamma(\\alpha, \\beta)\\)\n\nconditional distributions:\n\\(f(b_0|b_1,b_2,b_3,\\tau,Y_1,...,Y_n) \\sim N(\\frac{\\tau}{n\\tau + \\tau_b}\\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i -(b_1x_{1i} + b_2x_{2i} + b_3x_{3i}), \\frac{1}{n\\tau + \\tau_b})\\)\n\\(f(b_1|b_0,b_2,b_3,\\tau,Y_1,...,Y_n) \\sim N(\\frac{\\tau\\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i-(b_0 + b_2x_{2i} + b_3x_{3i})x_{1i})}{\\tau\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i^2+\\tau)}, \\frac{1}{\\tau\\sum_{i=1}^nx_{1i}^2 + \\tau_b})\\)\n...\n\\(f(\\tau|b_0,b_1,b_2,b_3,Y_1,...,Y_n) \\sim gamma(\\alpha+n/2,\\beta+\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i -(b_0 + b_1x_{1i} + b_2x_{2i} + b_3x_{3i})^2))\\)\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n Figure 1.

    "text": "Hi, I’m Hidde! I’m a PhD candidate in Pharmacometrics and Statistics at Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research (LACDR) under dr. Laura Zwep and Prof. dr. Coen van Hasselt. I graduated in June 2024 with a MSc in Methodology and Statistics at Utrecht University.\nCurrently I’m working on pharmacometric research in the field of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) in the LACDR. My research focusses on proper statistical methods for covariate model development and the usage of aggregate data in PKPD analysis. I’m also working on the development of a new R package for PKPD analysis in R, where I would like to contribute to the open science of nlmixr2.\nMy Masters Thesis was on the performance of Information Criteria and Internal validation techniques in a simulated setting. The project is based in Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care supervised by dr. Maarten van Smeden and dr. Anne de Hond.\nIn my free time I like to go hiking in Scotland, Norway, the Lake District, or anywhere else where I can find some mountains. Here I go back into the wild and enjoy the beautiful nature. I enjoy the bare necessities of life and the simplicity of the outdoors. Next spring I will go bikepacking in Italy, where I will cycle south to north through the Apennines.\nI used to row at U.S.R. Triton in Utrecht. Here I trained 10-12 times a week and competed in national and international competitions. My most beloved experience is reaching the semi-finals in the Temple eight of the Henley Royal Regatta in 2022. This one of the most prestigious rowing regattas in the world. Next to this, I won the prestigious Amstelbeker in 2024, a yearly national sprint competition for the best rowing clubs in the Netherlands."
