I’m planning to graduate in June 2024 and I’m currently looking for a PhD position.\nCurrently I’m writing my Thesis on the performance of Information Criteria and Internal validation techniques in a simulated setting. The project is based in Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care at University Medical Center Utrecht and supervised by dr. Maarten van Smeden and dr. Anne de Hond.\nIn my free time I’m a rower at U.S.R. Triton. Here I train 10-12 times a week and compete in national and international competitions. My most beloved experience is reaching the semi-finals in the Temple eight of the Henley Royal Regatta in 2022.\n\n\nUtrecht University | the Netherlands\nMSc Methodology and Statistics for the Behavioural, Biomedical and Social Sciences | Sept 2022 - present\nUtrecht University | the Netherlands\nBSc Psychology | Sept 2018 - June 2022\n\n\n\nUMC Utrecht | Teaching Assistant in Statistics | Sept 2023 - present\nUtrecht University | Teaching Assistant in Statistics | Sept 2021 - June 2023\n\n\n\nUtrecht University | Research Assistant | Sept 2021 - September 2023"
