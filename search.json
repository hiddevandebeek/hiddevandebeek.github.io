    "text": "admr package\nPharmacometric modelling is traditionally performed using individual level data. Recently a new method was developed to fit pharmacometric models to summary level – or aggregate – data. This methodology allows for jointly modelling different data sources, once transformed into aggregate data. As such, the method can be applied to a combination of individual data, pharmacometric models, and aggregate data. In this study we aimed to (1) implement this methodological framework into an accessible R package (admr) and (2) develop a novel algorithm with enhanced computational efficiency. The developed R-package allows calculating aggregate data from different data sources, jointly fitting one or multiple data sources and assessing model performance. The implementation of the newly developed algorithm improves computational efficiency by iteratively reweighting internal Monte Carlo predictions. Three simulation scenarios using different data generating models demonstrated an improvement of 3 to 100-fold speed-up when using the novel Iterative Reweighting Monte Carlo (IR-MC) algorithm, while maintaining the convergence properties of the original MC algorithm. These analyses demonstrated that estimation with the IR-MC algorithm is increasingly more efficient as model complexity rises as compared to the standard MC algorithm, indicating the utility for more complex pharmacometric models. In conclusion, the aggregate data modelling implementation in the admr R package allows for a fast and user-friendly application of the aggregate data modelling framework.\nA preprint of the article can be found here.

Herbert Hoijtink, the main goal was to develop a Gibbs sampler for a Bayesian linear regression model. By using two simulated data set the Gibbs sampler was tested and the results were compared. The Gibbs sampler was then applied to a real data set to identify the key factors that play a role in the University admittance process, using a open source data set. We used non-informative conjugate priors, as specified in the info note underneath. Next to this Bayesian Model Averaging was used to identify the most important variables in the model. The project was rewarded a 10.0/10.0 grade. The project can be found here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nTheorem\n\\(Y_i = b_0 + b_1x_{1i} + b_2x_{2i} + b_3x_{3i} + e_i\\) with \\(e_i\\) i.i.d. \\(\\sim N(0,1/\\tau)\\) and priors\n\\(b_0 ... b_3 \\sim N(0,1/\\tau_b)\\)\n\\(\\tau \\sim gamma(\\alpha, \\beta)\\)\n\nconditional distributions:\n\\(f(b_0|b_1,b_2,b_3,\\tau,Y_1,...,Y_n) \\sim N(\\frac{\\tau}{n\\tau + \\tau_b}\\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i -(b_1x_{1i} + b_2x_{2i} + b_3x_{3i}), \\frac{1}{n\\tau + \\tau_b})\\)\n\\(f(b_1|b_0,b_2,b_3,\\tau,Y_1,...,Y_n) \\sim N(\\frac{\\tau\\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i-(b_0 + b_2x_{2i} + b_3x_{3i})x_{1i})}{\\tau\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i^2+\\tau)}, \\frac{1}{\\tau\\sum_{i=1}^nx_{1i}^2 + \\tau_b})\\)\n...\n\\(f(\\tau|b_0,b_1,b_2,b_3,Y_1,...,Y_n) \\sim gamma(\\alpha+n/2,\\beta+\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i -(b_0 + b_1x_{1i} + b_2x_{2i} + b_3x_{3i})^2))\\)\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n Figure 1.

    "text": "Hi, I’m Hidde! I’m a PhD candidate in Pharmacometrics and Statistics at Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research (LACDR) under supervision of dr. Laura Zwep and Prof. dr. Coen van Hasselt. I graduated in June 2024 with a MSc in Methodology and Statistics at Utrecht University.\nCurrently I’m working on pharmacometric research in the field of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) in the LACDR. My research focusses on proper statistical methods for covariate model development and the usage of aggregate data in PKPD analysis. I’m recently published the R package admr for aggregate data population PK modelling.\nIn my free time I like to go hiking in Scotland, Norway, the Lake District, or anywhere else where I can find some mountains. Here I go back into the wild and enjoy the beautiful nature. I enjoy the bare necessities of life and the simplicity of the outdoors. My most recent bikepacking trip was to Italy, where I cycled from Rome to Como crossing the Apennines. My most recent hiking trip was Troms border trail at the Norwegian-Swedish-Finish border, where I hiked 150 km in 10 days through the summer-time arctic nature.\nI used to row at U.S.R. Triton in Utrecht. Here I trained 10-12 times a week and competed in national and international competitions. My most beloved experience is reaching the semi-finals in the Temple eight of the Henley Royal Regatta in 2022. This one of the most prestigious rowing regattas in the world. Next to this, I won the prestigious Amstelbeker in 2024, a yearly national sprint competition for the best rowing clubs in the Netherlands."
