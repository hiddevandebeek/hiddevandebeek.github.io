    "text": "Hi, I’m Hidde! I’m a Master’s student at Utrecht University, where I study Methodology and Statistics. I’m planning to graduate in June 2024 and I’m currently looking for a PhD position for September 2024.\nCurrently I’m writing my Thesis on the performance of Information Criteria and Internal validation techniques in a simulated setting. The project is based in Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care supervised by dr. Maarten van Smeden and dr. Anne de Hond.\nIn my free time I’m a rower at U.S.R. Triton. Here I train 10-12 times a week and compete in national and international competitions. My most beloved experience is reaching the semi-finals in the Temple eight of the Henley Royal Regatta in 2022. This one of the most prestigious rowing regattas in the world."

    "text": "Bayesian Statistics\nIn this project for the course Bayesian Statistics by Prof. dr. Herbert Hoijtink, the main goal was to develop a Gibbs sampler for a Bayesian linear regression model. By using two simulated data set the Gibbs sampler was tested and the results were compared. The Gibbs sampler was then applied to a real data set to identify the key factors that play a role in the University admittance process, using a open source data set. We used non-informative conjugate priors, as specified in the info note underneath. Next to this Bayesian Model Averaging was used to identify the most important variables in the model. The project was rewarded a 10.0/10.0 grade. The project can be found here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\n\nTheorem\n\\(Y_i = b_0 + b_1x_{1i} + b_2x_{2i} + b_3x_{3i} + e_i\\) with \\(e_i\\) i.i.d. \\(\\sim N(0,1/\\tau)\\) and priors\n\\(b_0 ... b_3 \\sim N(0,1/\\tau_b)\\)\n\\(\\tau \\sim gamma(\\alpha, \\beta)\\)\n\nconditional distributions:\n\\(f(b_0|b_1,b_2,b_3,\\tau,Y_1,...,Y_n) \\sim N(\\frac{\\tau}{n\\tau + \\tau_b}\\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i -(b_1x_{1i} + b_2x_{2i} + b_3x_{3i}), \\frac{1}{n\\tau + \\tau_b})\\)\n\\(f(b_1|b_0,b_2,b_3,\\tau,Y_1,...,Y_n) \\sim N(\\frac{\\tau\\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i-(b_0 + b_2x_{2i} + b_3x_{3i})x_{1i})}{\\tau\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i^2+\\tau)}, \\frac{1}{\\tau\\sum_{i=1}^nx_{1i}^2 + \\tau_b})\\)\n...\n\\(f(\\tau|b_0,b_1,b_2,b_3,Y_1,...,Y_n) \\sim gamma(\\alpha+n/2,\\beta+\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i -(b_0 + b_1x_{1i} + b_2x_{2i} + b_3x_{3i})^2))\\)\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n Figure 1.
