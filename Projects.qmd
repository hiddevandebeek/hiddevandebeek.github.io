# Bayesian Statistics

In this project, the main goal was to develop a Gibbs sampler for a Bayesian linear regression model. By using two simulated data set the Gibbs sampler was tested and the results were compared. The Gibbs sampler was then applied to a real data set to identify the key factors that play a role in the university admittance process. Next to this Bayesian Model Average was used to identify the most important variables in the model. The project was rewarded a 10.0/10.0 grade.

**Theorem**\
$Y_i = b_0 + b_1x_{1i} + b_2x_{2i} + b_3x_{3i} + e_i$ with $e_i$ i.i.d. $\sim N(0,1/\tau)$ and priors\
$b_0 ... b_3 \sim N(0,1/\tau_b)$\
$\tau \sim gamma(\alpha, \beta)$\

**which result in the conditional distributions**\
$f(b_0|b_1,b_2,b_3,\tau,Y_1,...,Y_n) \sim N(\frac{\tau}{n\tau + \tau_b}\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i -(b_1x_{1i} + b_2x_{2i} + b_3x_{3i}), \frac{1}{n\tau + \tau_b})$\
$f(b_1|b_0,b_2,b_3,\tau,Y_1,...,Y_n) \sim N(\frac{\tau\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i-(b_0 + b_2x_{2i} + b_3x_{3i})x_{1i})}{\tau\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i^2+\tau)}, \frac{1}{\tau\sum_{i=1}^nx_{1i}^2 + \tau_b})$ \
\...\
$f(\tau|b_0,b_1,b_2,b_3,Y_1,...,Y_n) \sim gamma(\alpha+n/2,\beta+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i -(b_0 + b_1x_{1i} + b_2x_{2i} + b_3x_{3i})^2))$
